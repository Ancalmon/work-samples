/* File Name: MyFile
 * Author: Luke Fitzsimmons
 * Date: 3/25/2017
 *Program Description: This is a program that creates a file named MyFile.txt
 *if MyFile.txt does not exist yet. It will write 100 integers which are created 
 *randomly inside the file using text I/O. Integers are eached seperated by a 
 *space in the file. Then the data is read back from the file and is
 * sorted and displayed. Various methods are used to write the data into the
 *files, read data from the files, and print the sorted data from the files.
