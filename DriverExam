 * This is a program for the local DMV that tests student's 
 * on their knowledge of driving laws. It holds the grades of the written 
 * written portion of the driver's license exam. The exam has 20 multiple choice 
 * questions and the answers are held in this class and called in DriverExamTest.java.
 * The exam answers are held in an array field, the class also has an array 
 * field for student's answers. This class has the following methods: passed, 
 * totalCorrect, totalIncorrect, and questionsMissed. Passed returns true if the 
 * student passes the exam, and false if the student fails the exam. In order to pass
 * the student must answer 15 out of the 20 questions correctly. totalCorrect 
 * returns the total number of correctly answered questions. totalMissed returns 
 * the total number of incorrectly answered questions. questionsMissed holds an 
 * int array containing the question numbers of the questions that the student 
 * missed. This class calls the StringMethods class for data validation.
